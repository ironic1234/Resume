# Ronak Jain â€” Resume

This repository contains my LaTeX resume, automatically compiled and released via GitHub Actions.

## ðŸ›  Workflow

On every push to the `main` branch:

- `main.tex` is compiled into a PDF using `latexmk`
- The PDF is named `Ronak_Jain_Resume-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.pdf`
- A GitHub release is created with the same timestamp and the PDF attached
